bio: I am a research scientist at Qualcomm AI Research in Amsterdam, Netherlands. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from KAUST in Saudi Arabia advised by [Prof. Bernard Ghanem](https://www.bernardghanem.com/). I also obtained my M.Sc degree in Electrical Engineering from KAUST, and my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from Kuwait University. I am interested in domain shifts, LLM safety, and how to combat them with test-time adaptation and continual learning. I helped co-organizing the [first](https://tta-cvpr2024.github.io) and [second](https://tta-icml2025.github.io) workshops on Test-Time Adaptation at CVPR2024 and ICML2025 and the ICLR2026 workshop on [Monitoring ML Models Under Drift](https://sites.google.com/view/iclr-2026-workshop-cao/).
